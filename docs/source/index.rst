Introduction
============
   
RdfPandas is a module providing RDF support for Pandas. It consists of 
two simple functions for graph conversion, one is to create DataFrame from 
RDFLib Graph data, and another one to create Graph data from DataFrame. 

The graph data can then be serialized using RDFLib serialize method on the 
graph.
